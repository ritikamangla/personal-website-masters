I am a Master's in Computer Science student at the University of Texas at Austin. I am currently advised by Dr. Jessy Li (co-advisor Dr. Greg Durrett). My research is focused on understanding discourse relationships using the linguistic framework of QuD (Question under Discussion). I am working on developing an evaluation framework for QuD parsers and exploring QuD ranking.

In addition to this, I have a keen interest in music. I am a music aficionado at heart and the days I seem to hit the wrong note, my guitar helps me harmonize. My days aren't complete without an element of music.
