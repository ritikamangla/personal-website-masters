# abstract: Customer churn speculation is aimed at finding customers with a high potential for attraction. Predictive accuracy, Precision, and justification are the three critical elements of a churn predictive model. According to domain knowledge, the Accurate standards of the model allow us to identify the main drivers for customers to churn and develop an effective retention strategy. In this research paper, we present a comparative study of the most popular machine learning classifiers used to solve the problem of churning customers in the telecommunications sector. In the first phase of our test, all models were implemented and tested using statistical evaluative measures on the popular telecom database. In the second phase, the performance improved by boosting was studied. In order to determine the most efficient parameter combinations, we performed hyperparameter tuning for the best classifier and a wide range of parameters. The best overall classifier was XG Boost classifier after Hyperparameter tuning with an accuracy of almost 82% and Precision of 0.8.

# # Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This paper focuses on plotting a network of Twitter users, based on a particular hashtag, and detecting the communities in it, followed by detecting and locating the bots in these communities. In addition to this, sentiment analysis is conducted on normal users’ tweets as well as the bots in these communities. This paper also aims to identify the overall sentiment of the communities, and thus provide promising conclusions relating to bot behavior in the overall network.

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p class="pub-abstract">The globe has been dominated today by Online Social Networks (OSN) like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. However, the rise of popularity and attractiveness of these web based services has also led to the rise of malicious accounts known as bots. Not only do they cause Internet traffic, but also a group of these accounts working together can spread disinformation, incorrect, or manipulated news. The detection of bots, as well as their interactions with their communities and the rest of the world, is essential. This paper focuses on plotting a network of Twitter users, based on a particular hashtag, and detecting the communities in it, followed by detecting and locating the bots in these communities. In addition to this, sentiment analysis is conducted on normal users’ tweets as well as the bots in these communities. This paper also aims to identify the overall sentiment of the communities, and thus provide promising conclusions relating to bot behavior in the overall network.</p>
